Are you dreaming me?
Is this feeling you?
Are you thinking similar things
Or must i think for two?
Are we on our side?
Has our case been tried?
Has the thought of leaving ever left you?
(Like a tide)

Should we carry on?
Or has it all been done now?

Is this what you heard?
Has the end occurred?
Is the last beat heard?
