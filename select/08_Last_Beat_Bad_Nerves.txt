You tap your foot to the last beat on your own
You tap your foot to the last beat on your own
You tap your foot to the last beat on your own
You tap your foot to the last beat alone

Well I just don't know what I'm running away from
I'm close to blowing up my heart
You tap your foot to the last beat on your own

Tap your foot to the last beat
You tap your foot to the last beat on your own
Tap your foot to the last beat
You tap your foot to the last beat alone

Well I just don't know what I'm running away from
I'm close to blowing up my heart
You tap your foot to the last beat on your own, on your own
You tap your foot to the last beat on your own, on your own
You tap your foot to the last beat alone

Tap your foot to the last beat
You tap your foot to the last beat on your own
Tap your foot to the last beat
You tap your foot to the last beat alone

Tap your foot to the last beat
You tap your foot to the last beat on your own
Tap your foot to the last beat
You tap your foot to the last beat alone

It's the last beat
It's the last beat on your own
It's the last beat
It's the last beat on your own

Well I just don't know what I'm running away from
I'm close to blowing up my heart
You tap your foot to the last beat on your own, on your own
You tap your foot to the last beat on your own, on your own
You tap your foot to the last beat alone
