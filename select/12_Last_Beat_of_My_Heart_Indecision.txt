in a wave of forgiveness
on angels wings
we dare to breathe
reach out your hands
don't turn your back, don't walk away
How in the world could i wish for this
never to be torn apart
close to you until the last beat of my heart
at the close of day
these words in shadow play
here and now, here and now
my heart cries out
the naked bone of an echo says
don't walk away
reach out your hands
reach our your hands - i'm just a step away
